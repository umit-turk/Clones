# Getting Started with Create React App
 I created my project with bootstrap then I added to bootstrap link  also fontAwesome in index.html.

 1) I created Navbar  as a function component then put the bootstrap codes inside of navbar JSX structure.After that I created Footer.js with bootstrap and arranged the templates.
 
 2) We need to use a Api to reach to open movie database and I took a api from OMDb API.
